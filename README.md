## Introduction

This repository is designed to provide clear and concise implementations of classic neural network architectures. These models serve as the foundation for many advanced deep learning applications. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, you'll find useful resources and examples to enhance your understanding and implementation skills.

## Models and Projects

### MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)
The MultiLayer Perceptron is a fully connected neural network model used for a variety of tasks, including classification and regression. This implementation demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate an MLP using Python and popular deep learning frameworks.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks are powerful models for processing and analyzing visual data. This section includes implementations of CNN architectures for image recognition and classification tasks. You'll learn how to construct and train CNNs, and apply them to real-world image datasets.

### Image Captioning Project (LSTM + CNN)
The Image Captioning Project combines CNNs for image feature extraction and LSTM networks for generating descriptive captions. This project showcases an end-to-end pipeline for creating an image captioning system, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each model and project is contained within its own directory. You can find detailed instructions and example scripts within each directory. Below is an example of how to use the MLP implementation:

```python
from mlp import MultiLayerPerceptron

# Load your dataset
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = load_data()

# Initialize and train the MLP
mlp = MultiLayerPerceptron(input_size=X_train.shape[1], hidden_layers=[64, 32], output_size=10)
mlp.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, learning_rate=0.01)

# Evaluate the MLP
accuracy = mlp.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy}")
```
